wanna do something similar to lease agreement for the deposit agreement


Create PandaDoc Lease


need to get form id from Jen
then go in and set up conditionals



create generic deposit agreement and have different product sheets in it
fill in fields with web hook call within workflow
form id is in URL



start with 2024 product specs
freightliner cascadia day cab specs


test environment - deposit agreement - generic doc

go to products and filter product category by trucks
is there a way to dynamically update the product code conditionals when new product spec document is added to panda docs

on Sales ORder CRM - New STatus - "Create Deposit Agreement"
new workflow - dependent upon new status update
create zap to pandadoc
create a web hook to zapier to pass data to panda docs
modify smartcontent on pandadoc in generic D.A. to select proper specs



create a new one off of a 2024 copy, remove specs and add smartcontent between appendix c and document
